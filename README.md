### Story 1.0: PRS Player Mode

As a frequent games player, I'd like to play rock, paper, scissors so that I can
spend an hour of my day having fun

1. As a player, I would like to be able to initiate a new game in which I can chose
   how the game is played with the following play modes

   - Me vs the computer
   - Computer vs computer

2. As I play the game, I would like to see how well I am doing against my opponent (for both play modes), as such I would like to keep a running tally of wins, draws and losses

3. As I play the game and with the data gathered from my wins, draws and losses, Iâ€™d like to get some simple statistical analysis of my results

4. If possible, I would also like to have the option to choose the level (say Beginner,Intermediate and Advance) when playing against the computer

### Technical Guidance

We are looking for a web-based game and are looking for candidates who can demonstrates some or all following development skills:

- C#
- SQL Server
- ASP.Net Core or ASP.Net MVC development
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap Framework experience
- JavaScript
- TypeScript experience is preferable

### Development Guidance

We are not expecting you to create a fully formed game, but we are looking for a well formed, well tested
and a full stack solution (front, middle and back end).
There is no need to persist your results to a database (i.e. session stored will be fine) but we are looking
for good data models etc.
As stated, we are not looking for a full-blown thing but something that is well crafted and well tested
code. We expect to see unit tests and well factored code.
